    <h1>Limitations Are Self-Imposed</h1>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-6">I hate the phrase <em>“I can’t.”</em> Let me tell you why.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">This aversion comes from a lifelong frustration with predetermined boundaries—the closed-system scripts that dictate what you're supposed to do and who you're supposed to be. Growing up, any deviation felt like ruining a communal play, an outdated script everyone kept performing out of habit. I wanted to step off the stage and draw my own path.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">It’s this same frustration I felt when a friend dismissed the idea of pivoting to product management by saying, “I can’t, I don’t code.” My immediate reaction was confusion: “Then learn?” The word “can’t” often isn’t an accurate assessment of possibility; it’s a self-imposed limit placed before the attempt.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">For a long time, I couldn’t explain why I felt so passionate about New York City. The answer revealed itself during my second time living there: everyone drawn to NYC shares this same aversion to limitation. Symbolically, the high variation across its neighborhoods and the towering skyscrapers represent a lack of upper boundary. The beauty of New York is that it celebrates multiplicity—you can start a new job in investment banking, pursue acting on the side, and DJ at a local venue on the weekends.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">Limits themselves are completely optional—the only purpose they serve is to design your system in a way that produces a more filtered result. My message isn't to condemn those who choose to have them. I believe that judicious filtering is rewarding. However, there is a critical distinction between being filtered and being constrained, and the difference depends entirely on your intention (in operations research, also known as the objective function).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">Think about why you are introducing limitations: Do you want to remove the noise, or do you want to minimize uncertainty?</p>
      <p class="mt-4">The distinction is that the desire to “remove the noise” stems from confidence in a particular goal, it is a productive approach, while wanting to “minimize uncertainty” is a result of fear of failure or ambiguity. One sharpens focus, while the other shrinks potential.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">Limitations were initially created to install structure, but unstructure is where innovation flourishes. Structure is protection—it keeps systems stable and predictable. Yet, there’s a tipping point where protection transforms into complacency and, ultimately, self-constraint. Our bodies provide the perfect analogy: nerves warn us not to overextend by creating pain, much like a flinch when you touch something hot. But touching the heat isn't always bad; it depends on how you perceive it. Fire can burn, yes—but it can also forge, illuminate, or transform. The difference lies in your relationship to the discomfort.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="mt-4">I actually came to this realization doing planks on a Tuesday evening. I’d always believed my limit was a minute and a half. This time, I was so distracted by the music and my own thoughts that I stayed in the position without straining. When I finally looked at the timer, it was two minutes. I didn't feel constrained until I saw the time—the limit wasn't physical; it was purely cognitive.</p>

      <p class="mt-4"><em>“I can’t” isn’t a fact; it’s a decision.</em></p>

      <p class="mt-4">Ultimately, your relationship with limits boils down to your objective function: are you using a boundary to remove the noise, or are you seeking to minimize your personal discomfort with uncertainty? <strong>One sharpens focus, while the other shrinks potential.</strong></p>
